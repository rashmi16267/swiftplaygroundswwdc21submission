Abstract :

- Groot (no copyright intended) is surrounded by his tree friends who occupy a different position every time the playground code is run.
- Groot can also be moved around as needed (via touch) to go meet his other tree friends.


Introduction :

- A small 2D interactive environment which allows the user to interact with and move Groot around to go stand near his friends, the trees.
- Groot can be moved via touch and will follow the cursor to go where the user guides him.
- Each time the game is reloaded, the trees will assume different positions based on a random variable.
