originally, i could not complete my swift playground file according to plan since i ran out of time and this was what i submitted for the contest (because why not)

Playground objective :

Groot (no copyright intended) is surrounded by his tree friends who occupy a different position everytime the playground code is run. Groot can also be moved around as needed (via touch) to go meet his other tree friends.
